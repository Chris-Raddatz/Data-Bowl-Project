# Football-Bash

This was a winter project that I did for fun using the NFL Data Bowl Data. 

I wanted to see if there was any difference between the top and bottom players of the NFL physically. Secondly I used KMeans clusteirng to segment corner backs specifically, which brought up some interesting results that could be fun to look at in the future. I used several libaries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Sklearn in this project.
