Therefore, I made a simpler data analysis project out of this, with a task of answering the question: *Do high-performing athletes in the NFL have a remarkably different physical build compared to the benchwarmers?*\n\n## Hypothesis\nI thought that there wouldn't be too much of a difference as scouts and the combine seem to look for certain traits amongst players when they are drafted. But I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. \n\n## Plan\nIn this notebook I merge dataframes supplied by the NFL to calculate a contribution efficiency statistic by summing tackles, assists and fumbles divided by possible tackles. I then split the dataframe into 2 to look at the top half and bottom half of performers physically. I visualized the differences by position side by side with Seaborn and Matplotlib, then proceeded to do a hypothesis test between the two populations. \n\n## Extra\nFinally I wanted to add in some clustering to try and partition the players, I decided to focus on cornerbacks as they were one of the most populated positions in this dataframe. I used an elbow plot to identify clusters, used KMeans and then plotted results showing results. I then used [PFF's grading system](https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-cornerback-rankings-final-sauce-gardner-retains-his-place-as-the-no-1-cornerback-in-the-nfl) to start a search for which cluster contained the *premier* corner backs in the league. This led me to some cool insights and a thought that one could use this data as a predictor to find rising stars at the position.
